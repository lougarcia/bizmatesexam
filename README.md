### About Implementation

- I have made a simple "two-page" app for easy navigation.
- The small widgets shows the minimum data a user requires to check the current weather.
- More weather information is shown when user clicks on a widget.
- Foursquare search results is also loaded

#### Notes:

- If I would redo this, I'd include the daily weather data in the home page widgets with Day, Temperature, Weather/Icon
- Also add a link to Foursquare at the middle-bottom of the widget which will open a dialog box of search results

OR

- City name, current weather and temperatue on the top
- A scrolling list of foursquare search result in the body of the widget
